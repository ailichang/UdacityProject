			<p>The Beluga Whale, also known as the White Whale, the melonhead, the sea canary (or simply, the beluga), is a mid-sized toothed whale species.
				 The beluga is one of the most distinct species of whales that is distinguishable especially for its unusual color and high-pitched twitter.
			   The mammal is one of the 76 cetacean species and is one of the two members of the Monodontidae family (other being, the Narwhal), and the only member of genus Delphinapterus.
			   Moving around in small groups or pods mainly in the Arctic waters, every year they draw a large number of tourists to Alaska, where they are one of the most popular aquatic animals.</p>
