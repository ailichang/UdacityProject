Your response goes here!

* What new skills have you learned?

  I learned "superscript," "horizontal rule," and "strikethrough". I loved the hints, because I don't even know how to say those in English. 
* What has been easy?

  The project is quite easy actually.
* What has been difficult?
  
  Guessing header size and the gap between. It would be easier if I know the character size and gap length.
* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?


  This is the first project :)
